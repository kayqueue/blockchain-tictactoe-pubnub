Steps to recreate the game:
---------------------------
IMPORTANT: Please delete all the json files, including board.json, and subscribe_message.txt before proceeding to recreate the game.

Step 1 - Generate the genesis block
-----------------------------------
- Change directory to Assignment3/
- run the following command in the command line interface
CLI: python3 genesis_block.py

Step 2 - Connecting to Pubnub channel
-------------------------------------
- Open up a terminal in Assignment3/Alice. For clarity, I will call this Terminal_Alice
- Run the command:
CLI: python3 launch_pubnub.py
--> After executing the command, please check that "subscribe_message.txt" is created.

- Open up a separate terminal in Assignment3/Bob, For clarity, I will call this Terminal_Bob
- Run the command:
CLI: python3 launch_pubnub.py
--> After executing the command, please check that three files are created - "0.json", "board.json", and "subscribe_message.txt".

--> Head over to Assignment3/Alice and make sure that two more files are created - "0.json" and "board.json"

Step 3 - Alice's turn
----------------------
- Under Terminal_Alice, open up a new tab. For clarity, I will call the tab Alice_Tab. This tab will be used to send Alice's moves(blocks) to the other player through the pubnub channel.
- Execute the following command in Alice_Tab to make a move:
CLI: python3 send_block.py

After every execution of the send_block.py command in the terminal, look out for the following:
1 - the json block and the state of the tic-tac-toe board will be displayed in Terminal_Alice and Terminal Bob.

2 - a json file will be created e.g. 1.json, 2.json


Step 4 - Bob's turn
-------------------
- Under Terminal_Bob, open up a new tab. For clarity, I will call the tab Bob_Tab. This tab will be used to send Bob's moves(blocks) to the other player through the pubnub channel.
- Execute the following command in Bob_Tab to make a move:
CLI: python3 send_block.py

After every execution of the send_block.py command in the terminal, look out for the following:
1 - the json block and the state of the tic-tac-toe board will be displayed in Terminal_Alice and Terminal Bob.

2 - a json file will be created e.g. 1.json, 2.json

Step 5 - Game ends
------------------
- Once a winner is found OR a draw is concluded, alternate between Step 3 and Step 4.
- Once the game ends, execute a ctrl + z keypress to terminate the pubnub connection in Terminal_Alice and Terminal_Bob
